This is to remove the chalk color on t5 for people who want to use custom iwi files for chalk on zombies!

* How To Install

Download the zip file and unzip the .gsc script

Press win+r then type in %localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t5\scripts\sp

You will be brought to the scripts folder here, this is where you need to know if you want the solo install
or the private match install!

Private Match Install:

Place the .gsc file into the Zom folder in the scripts folder, then launch the game


Solo Install:

Create a folder for each map just like in the pic below. Then place the script into each one of the folders
This is due to the zom folder not loading into solo games. Now launch the game play!
